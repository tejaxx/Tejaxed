            Hello. I'm Tejasvi but I go by Tejas. I made this website as my first coding project.
            Ok. Not really because it was a snake game but I looked the code online and felt guilty,
            so I decided to make a blog instead. I had been thinking of making one for a long time because
            I have these interesting theories about random stuff that comes to my head and I like sharing it
            you know.
            </p>
            <p class="Ab-content">
                A little bit about myself; I'm a full time student studying computer science. I also like to 
                experiment on myself with different things, like sometimes I make a theory and try to experiment it on myself.
                I don't think my ideas are original as anyone with capacity to think can come across these thoughts. They might
                not even make sense even. Aside from the Philosophy lore, I'm trying to be consistent with gym, making hobbies,
                getting a life basically. If you're reading this I'm happy there's someone I can share my thoughts with.
            </p>
            <p class="Ab-content">
            I will post about my opinions - or so called "theories" - about life, death, existence, religion, and everything
            that I find interesting. I will try to post weekly or depending on mood. I hope you guys have fun reading them!
